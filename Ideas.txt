Check infinite path length 
Check strongly connected

check the timestamp dates and see how it looks , to maybe find out how many publications in every year or when there is  a conference every month,
Using the temporal community can we predict the making of a new paper or when it can be published?
See how fast the community is building and so on?



Check how to make a GNN for link prediction, then remove say half of the found community and see if that community is loosing their vlaue?
Maybe from the predicted links you can predict what kind of paper you can make in the future from the previously given citation?
From say a predicting a missing link can the community of papers grow stronger or weaker?
